# React-Admin Demo

This is a demo of the [react-admin](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin) library for React.js. It creates a working administration for a fake poster shop named Posters Galore. You can test it online at [https://marmelab.com/react-admin-demo](https://marmelab.com/react-admin-demo).

React-admin usually requires a REST server to provide data. In this demo however, the REST server is simulated by the browser (using [FakeRest](https://github.com/marmelab/FakeRest)). 

The source code is available in the main [marmelab/react-admin](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin) repository, in the [examples/demo/](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/tree/master/examples/demo) directory. To explore it, start with [src/index.tsx](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/blob/master/examples/demo/src/index.tsx).

This repository only contains the compiled code served by the GitHub CDN at https://marmelab.com/react-admin-demo. You can find this production code [in the `gh-pages` branch](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin-demo/tree/gh-pages) of this repository.
